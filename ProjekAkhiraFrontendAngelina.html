    <h1>About Formula 1</h1>
    <p>Formula 1 is the premier motorsport championship where the best drivers and teams compete for glory. Formula 1, or F1, is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Renowned for its intense competition, cutting-edge technology, and worldwide fanbase, F1 represents the pinnacle of motorsport. Each season, a series of Grand Prix races are held on iconic circuits and urban tracks around the globe, challenging teams and drivers to push their cars to the limits. Teams, composed of elite engineers and strategists, work tirelessly to develop aerodynamically advanced cars for optimal performance, while drivers showcase their skill and precision at speeds often exceeding 200 mph (320 km/h). F1 also serves as a testing ground for automotive innovations, with some advancements later applied to everyday vehicles. The sport’s global appeal is fueled by rivalries between top drivers and teams, all competing for the ultimate prizes: the Driver’s and Constructor’s Championships.</p>
